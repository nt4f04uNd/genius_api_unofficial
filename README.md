# Use Genius Lyrics API with ease

This library provides you with a nice interface to Genius API.
*It's not an official Genius product*.

All the available [API documentation](https://docs.genius.com/) is copied
and adapted into comments for you to see the usage of classes/methods right from an IDE.

All the API-related classes are prefixed with `GeniusApi`.

## Classes

### Core classes

* `GeniusApiOptions` allows you to configure method calls.
* `GeniusApiTextFormat` is the requested server response format.
* `GeniusApiResponse` contains the response of a successful method call.
* `GeniusApiException` will be thrown when http status code differs from 2xx.

### Main API classes

* `GeniusApiAuth` allows you to get an accessToken, both on server or client.
* `GeniusApiRaw` provides all the other officially documented methods.
* `GeniusApi` is basic abstract API class that you can extend to write your own implementations.

## Plans

I'm planning to add some more Genius API implementations in the future
(like `GeniusApiRawExtended` or `GeniusApiWrapped`).

There's what I think I will eventually add in new implementations:

* some utility methods
* fully typed method calls and responses
* [undocumented endpoints](https://github.com/shaedrich/geniusly/wiki/Undocumented-API-endpoints)

For now the library only provides the comprehensive interface to Genius API
through the `GeniusApiRaw` implementation, nothing more.

## Usage

Each method is documented fairly well and has pretty the same parameters, as listed
in the official API doc.

You can find usage examples for each of them in [tests folder](https://github.com/nt4f04uNd/genius_api_unofficial/tree/master/test/tests).

A simple usage example:

```dart
final api = GeniusApiRaw(
  accessToken: 'token here',
// Set all methods to return plain text instead of the default dom format.
  defaultOptions: GeniusApiOptions(textFormat: GeniusApiTextFormat.plain),
);

// Get info about song "https://genius.com/Yxngxr1-riley-reid-lyrics".
final res = await api.getSong(4585202);
print(res.data!['song']['full_title']); // Outputs "Riley Reid by â€‹yxngxr1"
```
